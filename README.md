## Why GenAI?

This project leverages GenAI for real-world impact in the fitness domain:

- **Clarifai GPT-4o**:
  - Used for **multi-modal inference** — understands equipment and exercise types from visual input
  - Provides reasoning over workout structure and planning
- **GPT-4o / LLMs** (via prompt chaining):
  - Generates clear, goal-specific workout plans
  - Outputs include warm-up, circuits, and cooldown in structured JSON
- **OpenCV**:
  - Enables **video compatibility** by extracting the first frame from uploaded videos
  - Seamlessly integrates with AI pipeline for consistent analysis

---

## Built With

- **React** — Interactive frontend UI
- **Flask (Python)** — Lightweight backend API
- **OpenCV** — Video frame extraction on backend
- **Clarifai GPT-4o API** — GenAI image understanding + plan generation
- **RESTful APIs** — Clean separation of frontend and backend
- (Optional) **SQLite / DB** — Extendable for history/logging features
